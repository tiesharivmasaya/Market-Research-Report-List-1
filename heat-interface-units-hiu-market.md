<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Interface Units (HIU) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect HIU</li><li>Direct HIU</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat Interface Units (HIUs) are essential components in district heating systems, managing the transfer of heat from a centralized source to individual buildings or apartments. The market is divided into two types: indirect HIUs and direct HIUs. Indirect HIUs utilize a heat exchanger to provide hot water, maintaining separation between the district heating system and the building's plumbing. Direct HIUs, on the other hand, connect directly to the heating network, offering more efficient heat transfer but potentially less control over water quality.</p></p>
