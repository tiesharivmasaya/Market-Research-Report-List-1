<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Seat Ventilation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blow</li><li>Suction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automobile seat ventilation system market features two primary types: blow and suction. Blow systems operate by pushing cooled air through the seat's fabric, enhancing comfort by providing a refreshing airflow directly to the occupant. In contrast, suction systems work by pulling warm air away from the body, creating a cooling effect by reducing humidity and heat buildup in the seat. Both technologies aim to improve passenger comfort, especially in hot climates, and are increasingly popular in modern vehicles.</p></p>
